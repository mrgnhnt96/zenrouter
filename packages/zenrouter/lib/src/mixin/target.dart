/// The base class for all navigation targets (routes).
///
/// A [RouteTarget] represents a destination in the app. It can hold state
/// and parameters. Every screen, dialog, or navigable destination should
/// extend this class.
///
/// ## Route Lifecycle
///
/// Routes go through distinct phases during their lifetime:
///
/// ```
/// ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
/// │                        ROUTE LIFECYCLE                              │
/// ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
/// │  1. CREATION        → Route instance created (constructor called)   │
/// │  2. REDIRECT CHECK  → RouteRedirect.redirect() called if applicable │
/// │  3. PATH BINDING    → Route assigned to a StackPath (_path set)     │
/// │  4. BUILD           → build() called to create the widget           │
/// │  5. ACTIVE          → Route is visible and receiving interactions   │
/// │  6. POP REQUEST     → User/system requests pop (guard consulted)    │
/// │  7. POP COMPLETION  → onDidPop() + completeOnResult() called        │
/// │  8. CLEANUP         → Route removed from path, _path set to null    │
/// └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
/// ```

/// ## Internal State
///
/// Routes maintain internal state managed by the framework:
/// - **`_path`**: The [StackPath] containing this route. Set during push.
/// - **`_onResult`**: A [Completer] that resolves when the route is popped.
/// - **`_resultValue`**: The result passed to [pop] before [onDidPop] is called.
/// - **`isPopByPath`**: Whether the pop was initiated by [StackPath.pop].
///
/// ## Result Handling
///
/// Routes can return a result when popped:
/// ```dart
/// // Pushing with result
/// final result = await coordinator.push<String>(SelectColorRoute());
/// print('Selected: $result');
///
/// // Popping with result (in route or widget)
/// coordinator.pop('blue');
/// ```
///
/// ## Equality
///
/// Override [props] to include route parameters in equality checks:
/// ```dart
/// class ProductRoute extends RouteTarget with RouteUnique {
///   final String productId;
///   ProductRoute(this.productId);
///
///   @override
///   List<Object?> get props => [productId];
/// }
/// ```

  ///
  /// This is called by Flutter's restoration framework when the app is being
  /// killed.

  /// - [RouteLayout] - Serialize [RouteLayout]
  /// - [RouteRestorable] - Call custom `serialize` method
  /// - [RouteUnique] - Leverage `toUri` for serialization

  /// Converts saved primitive data back into a route object.
  ///
  /// This is called by Flutter's restoration framework when the app is being
  /// restored. It receives the data that was previously returned by [toPrimitives]
  /// and reconstructs the route stack.
