/// A widget that enables state restoration for a [Coordinator] and its navigation hierarchy.
///
/// ## What This Widget Does
///
/// [CoordinatorRestorable] wraps your application's root widget to provide automatic
/// state restoration for the entire navigation stack managed by the [Coordinator].
/// When the operating system needs to reclaim resources and later restores your
/// application, this widget ensures that the user returns to exactly where they left
/// off, including the complete navigation history, active routes, and even nested
/// navigation stacks.
///
/// ## Where It Fits in the Architecture
///
/// **Important: This widget is used internally by [CoordinatorRouterDelegate] and you
/// typically do not need to use it directly.** The [CoordinatorRouterDelegate.build]
/// method automatically wraps your app's content with this widget when restoration is
/// enabled. It integrates with Flutter's [RestorationMixin] to participate in the
/// framework's restoration protocol, automatically saving and restoring state when
/// the application is backgrounded or terminated by the system.
///
/// The restoration hierarchy looks like this:
/// ```
/// MaterialApp.router(restorationScopeId: 'app')
///   └─ Router(routerDelegate: coordinator.routerDelegate)
///       └─ CoordinatorRestorable (automatically added by routerDelegate.build)
///           └─ NavigationStack(restorationId: 'root_stack')
///               └─ Your app widgets
/// ```
///
/// ## When Restoration Happens Automatically
///
/// Restoration is automatically enabled for your application when you provide a
/// `restorationScopeId` to [MaterialApp.router]. The framework handles all the
/// wrapping and state management internally. This is important for mobile
/// applications where the operating system may terminate your app to free memory,
/// and users expect to return to their previous screen when reopening the app.
///
/// **Restoration works automatically when:**
/// - You provide `restorationScopeId` to MaterialApp.router
/// - All your paths have unique `debugLabel` values
/// - You implement synchronous route parsing (or override `parseRouteFromUriSync`)
/// - Complex routes use [RouteRestorable] with registered converters
///
/// **Restoration is skipped when:**
/// - No `restorationScopeId` is provided to MaterialApp
/// - Your app is stateless or has only simple navigation
/// - You intentionally want users to start fresh on each launch
///
/// ## How to Enable Restoration
///
/// **Step 1: Enable restoration in your MaterialApp**
///
/// Provide a `restorationScopeId` to your [MaterialApp.router]. This automatically
/// enables the restoration framework for your entire application:
///
/// ```dart
/// MaterialApp.router(
///   restorationScopeId: 'main',  // This is all you need to enable restoration!
///   routerDelegate: coordinator.routerDelegate,
///   routeInformationParser: coordinator.routeInformationParser,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **That's it!** The [CoordinatorRouterDelegate] automatically uses this widget
/// internally. You don't need to wrap anything manually.
///
/// **Step 2: Ensure all paths have debug labels**
///
/// Every [StackPath] that participates in restoration must have a unique `debugLabel`.
/// This label is used as a key to identify which path's state belongs to which data
/// when restoring. Without this, restoration will fail with an assertion error:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyCoordinator extends Coordinator<MyRoute> {
///   late final tabsPath = NavigationPath<MyRoute>.create(
///     label: 'tabs',  // Required for restoration
///   );
///
///   @override
///   List<StackPath> get paths => [root, tabsPath];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Step 3: Implement synchronous route parsing**
///
/// If your [Coordinator.parseRouteFromUri] is asynchronous, you must override
/// [Coordinator.parseRouteFromUriSync] with a synchronous version. Restoration
/// cannot wait for asynchronous operations:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyCoordinator extends Coordinator<MyRoute> {
///   @override
///   Future<MyRoute> parseRouteFromUri(Uri uri) async {
///     // Async version (for normal navigation)
///     await someAsyncOperation();
///     return MyRoute.fromUri(uri);
///   }
///
///   @override
///   RouteUriParserSync<MyRoute> get parseRouteFromUriSync {
///     // Synchronous version (for restoration)
///     return (Uri uri) => MyRoute.fromUri(uri);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Step 4: Handle complex routes with custom serialization**
///
/// For routes that cannot be fully represented by a URI alone (e.g., routes with
/// in-memory state or complex objects), implement [RouteRestorable] with a custom
/// [RestorableConverter]:
///
/// ```dart
/// class ProductDetailRoute extends MyRoute with RouteRestorable<ProductDetailRoute> {
///   ProductDetailRoute({required this.product});
///
///   final Product product;  // Complex object that can't be in URL
///
///   @override
///   RestorationStrategy get strategy => RestorationStrategy.converter;
///
///   @override
///   RestorableConverter<ProductDetailRoute> get converter =>
///       const ProductDetailConverter();
/// }
///
/// class ProductDetailConverter extends RestorableConverter<ProductDetailRoute> {
///   const ProductDetailConverter();
///
///   @override
///   String get key => 'product_detail';
///
///   @override
///   Map<String, dynamic> serialize(ProductDetailRoute route) {
///     return {'productId': route.product.id, 'productName': route.product.name};
///   }
///
///   @override
///   ProductDetailRoute deserialize(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
///     return ProductDetailRoute(
///       product: Product(id: data['productId'], name: data['productName']),
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Important Considerations
///
/// **Restoration only saves navigation structure, not widget state:**
/// If individual screens have their own state (form inputs, scroll positions, etc.),
/// those widgets need their own [RestorationMixin] implementation. This widget only
/// restores which routes are on the stack and which route is active.
///
/// **Debug labels must be stable across app versions:**
/// If you change a path's `debugLabel` between app versions, restoration data for
/// that path will be lost. Plan your path naming strategy carefully.
///
/// **Restoration happens synchronously on startup:**
/// The restoration process blocks the UI from rendering until complete. Keep your
/// route parsing logic fast to avoid slow startup times.
///
/// See also:
/// - [RouteRestorable] for custom route serialization
/// - [RestorableConverter] for implementing custom converters
/// - [NavigationStack] which handles restoration for individual navigation paths

/// A [RestorableValue] that manages the restoration of the currently active route in the navigation stack.
///
/// ## What This Class Does
///
/// [ActiveRouteRestorable] is responsible for remembering which route was active (visible to the user)
/// when the application was backgrounded or terminated. When the application restores, this ensures
/// that the user returns to the exact same screen they were viewing, not just somewhere in the
/// navigation stack. This is a critical component of providing a seamless user experience where
/// interruptions from the operating system are invisible to the user.
///
/// ## Where It Fits in the Architecture
///
/// This class is used internally by [_CoordinatorRestorableState] to track the active route
/// separately from the full navigation stack. While the coordinator saves the entire stack of
/// routes for each path, this class specifically tracks which single route from which path
/// was active when the app was paused. Upon restoration, the coordinator uses this information
/// to navigate to the correct route using [Coordinator.navigate].
///
/// The restoration data flow looks like this:
/// ```
/// CoordinatorRestorableState
///   ├─ _CoordinatorRestorable       (saves ALL routes in ALL paths)
///   └─ ActiveRouteRestorable        (saves the ONE active route)
///        └─ On restore → Coordinator.navigate(activeRoute)
/// ```
///
/// ## When This Gets Called
///
/// **Saving (toPrimitives):**
/// This is called whenever the coordinator's active route changes. The [_CoordinatorRestorableState]
/// listens to coordinator changes via `_saveActiveRoute()` and updates this restorable's value,
/// which triggers serialization to the restoration bucket.
///
/// **Restoring (fromPrimitives):**
/// This is called during app startup when Flutter detects existing restoration data. It happens
/// synchronously before the first frame is rendered, ensuring the user never sees an intermediate
/// state. The restoration process deserializes the saved data back into a route object that the
/// coordinator can navigate to.
///
/// ## How It Handles Different Route Types
///
/// This class intelligently handles two different route serialization strategies:
///
/// **Strategy 1: RouteUnique (URI-based)**
/// Routes that implement [RouteUnique] can be completely represented by their URI. These are
/// serialized as simple strings and deserialized by calling [parseRouteFromUri]:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Route definition
/// class HomeRoute extends RouteTarget with RouteUnique {
///   @override
///   Uri toUri() => Uri.parse('/home');
/// }
///
/// // Serialized as: "/home"
/// // Deserialized via: parseRouteFromUri(Uri.parse("/home"))
/// ```
///
/// **Strategy 2: RouteRestorable (Custom serialization)**
/// Routes that implement [RouteRestorable] with custom converters can preserve complex state
/// that wouldn't fit in a URI. These are serialized as maps containing the converter key and
/// serialized data:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Route definition
/// class ProductRoute extends RouteTarget with RouteRestorable<ProductRoute> {
///   ProductRoute({required this.product});
///   final Product product;
///
///   @override
///   RestorationStrategy get strategy => RestorationStrategy.converter;
///
///   @override
///   RestorableConverter<ProductRoute> get converter => ProductConverter();
/// }
///
/// // Serialized as: {"strategy": "converter", "converter": "product", "value": {...}}
/// // Deserialized via: ProductConverter().deserialize(data)
/// ```
///
/// The class automatically detects which strategy to use by checking if the route implements
/// [RouteRestorable] during serialization, and by examining the data structure during
/// deserialization.
///
/// ## Important Implementation Details
///
/// **Null handling:**
/// This class properly handles null values, which occur when no route is active yet (app first
/// launch) or when the active route shouldn't be restored. The [createDefaultValue] returns
/// the [initialRoute] provided during construction, or null if none was provided.
///
/// **Type safety:**
/// The generic type parameter `<T extends RouteUnique>` ensures compile-time type safety while
/// still allowing the class to work with any route type that implements [RouteUnique]. The
/// route is cast to `T` after deserialization, which is safe because we control the serialization
/// format.
///
/// **Deserialization format detection:**
/// The [fromPrimitives] method uses pattern matching to detect whether the saved data is a
/// simple string (URI-based) or a map (custom converter-based), and handles each case appropriately.
///
/// See also:
/// - [RouteRestorable] for implementing custom route serialization
/// - [CoordinatorRestorable] for the overall restoration orchestration
/// - [RestorableValue] (Flutter framework) for the base restoration mechanism
