/// The core class that manages navigation state and logic.
///
/// ## Architecture Overview
///
/// ZenRouter uses a coordinator-based architecture where the [Coordinator]
/// is the central hub for all navigation operations.
///
/// ## Core Components
///
/// - **[Coordinator]**: Manages navigation state, handles deep links, and
///   coordinates between stack paths. Your app typically has one coordinator.
///
/// - **[StackPath]**: A container holding a stack of routes. Two variants:
///   - [NavigationPath]: Mutable stack (push/pop) for standard navigation
///   - [IndexedStackPath]: Fixed stack for indexed navigation (tabs)
///
/// - **[RouteTarget]**: Base class for all navigable destinations. Mix in:
///   - [RouteUnique]: Required for coordinator integration
///   - [RouteGuard]: Intercept and conditionally prevent pops
///   - [RouteRedirect]: Redirect to different routes
///   - [RouteLayout]: Define shell/wrapper with nested [StackPath]
///   - [RouteTransition]: Custom page transitions
///
/// ## Navigation Flow
///
/// When you call a navigation method:
///
/// 1. **Route Resolution**: [RouteRedirect.resolve] follows any redirects
/// 2. **Layout Resolution**: Find/create required [RouteLayout] hierarchy
/// 3. **Stack Update**: Push/pop/activate routes on appropriate [StackPath]
/// 4. **Widget Rebuild**: [NavigationStack] rebuilds with new pages
/// 5. **URL Update**: Browser URL synced via [CoordinatorRouterDelegate]
///
/// ## Navigation Methods
///
/// Choose the right navigation method for your use case:
///
/// | Method        | Use Case                                              |
/// |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
/// | [push]        | Standard forward navigation (adds to stack)           |
/// | [pop]         | Go back (removes from stack)                          |
/// | [replace]     | Reset navigation to a single route (clears stack)     |
/// | [navigate]    | Browser back/forward (smart stack manipulation)       |
/// | [recover]     | Deep link handling (respects [RouteDeepLink] strategy)|
///
/// See each method's documentation for detailed behavior and examples.
///
