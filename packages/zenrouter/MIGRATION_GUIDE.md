# Migration Guide

This guide outlines the changes and steps required to migrate to the latest version of `zenrouter`.

## Path Constructors

The constructors for `NavigationPath` and `IndexedStackPath` have been updated to provide better clarity and type safety, especially when binding to a `Coordinator`.

### Changes

- **Deprecated**: The default unnamed constructors `NavigationPath(...)` and `IndexedStackPath(...)`.
- **New**: `create` factory constructor for creating paths with optional arguments.
- **New**: `createWith` factory constructor for creating paths that are explicitly bound to a `Coordinator`.

### Migration

Replace direct constructor calls with `create` or `createWith`:

**Before:**
```dart
final path = NavigationPath(
  'root',
  [],
  coordinator,
);
```

**After (Standard):**
```dart
final path = NavigationPath.create(
  label: 'root',
  stack: [],
  coordinator: coordinator,
);
```

**After (With explicit Coordinator):**
```dart
late final path = NavigationPath.createWith(
  coordinator: this,
  label: 'root',
  stack: [],
);
```

Same applies to `IndexedStackPath`.

### Rationale

Deeply integrating paths with their coordinator using `createWith` provides several benefits:

1.  **Coordinator Awareness**: The path explicitly knows which coordinator it belongs to, enabling features like `popGuardWith` to verify that operations are happening in the correct context.
2.  **Safety**: Prevents a path from being used detached from its coordinator, which could lead to silent failures or incorrect state management.
3.  **Strict Binding**: The `late final ... = ... .createWith(coordinator: this, ...)` pattern ensures that the path and coordinator are 1:1 linked from the moment of creation, avoiding race conditions or initialization order issues.

### Trade-offs

*   **Coupling**: This approach tightly couples instances of `StackPath` to a specific `Coordinator`. While this is by design, it means paths are less "standalone".
*   **Testing**: Unit testing individual paths in isolation now requires providing a mock or dummy `Coordinator` if you use `createWith`, whereas previously they could be tested as simple data containers.
*   **Initialization**: Requires using `late final` variables in the `Coordinator` to handle the circular reference (Coordinator needs Path, Path needs Coordinator). Exceptions during initialization might be harder to debug if not careful.

**Why it is worth it:**
When using `createWith`, you are explicitly creating a path intended to work *with* a Coordinator. Therefore, this coupling is intentional and necessary. It guarantees that the path always has access to the correct context for advanced features like guards and redirects, making the system more robust and preventing common configuration errors.

## RouteGuard API

The `RouteGuard` mixin has been enhanced to support coordinator validation during pop operations.

### Changes

- **New**: `popGuardWith(Coordinator coordinator)` method.
  - This method is called by the framework when a pop is attempted.
  - It asserts that the route's path is associated with the correct coordinator.
  - It internally calls `popGuard()`.

- **Existing**: `popGuard()` remains the place to implement your custom guard logic.

### Migration

If you are manually calling `popGuard` in your custom logic or tests, consider using `popGuardWith` if you have access to the coordinator to benefit from the additional checks.

No changes are needed for existing `popGuard` implementations unless you are overriding the default behavior significantly.

## RouteRedirect API

The `RouteRedirect` mixin has been updated similarly to `RouteGuard`.

### Changes

- **New**: `redirectWith(Coordinator coordinator)` method.
  - Called by the framework during route resolution.
  - Helps ensuring the path belongs to the correct coordinator context.
  - Internally calls `redirect()`.

- **Existing**: `redirect()` remains the place to implement your redirect logic.

## Internal Properties (`internalProps`)

A new property `internalProps` has been introduced to the `Equatable` base class (and consequently `RouteTarget`) to handling deep comparison and hashing of internal state.

### Changes

- **`internalProps`**: A list of properties used for calculating `hashCode` and ensuring object identity, separate from the public `props`.
- `RouteTarget` now includes `runtimeType`, `_path`, and the internal result completer in `internalProps`.

### Impact

This ensures that `RouteTarget` instances are correctly distinguished even if they have identical configuration `props`, especially when they belong to different paths or have different lifecycle states. This improves the reliability of deep comparisons and sets containing routes.
